# reClaimer
As WallClaimer has decided to ban NSFW content from their platform, I and a few friends have decided to recreate the app from nothing, and let users who chose to decide who can put images as their wallpaper. On top of bringing back the ability to have NSFW content on the background, we'll also try and strengthen the friend request system.
